# Ferromagnetic-surface-simulation
The goal of this topic is to model ferromagnetic materials features. Indeed, a ferromagnetic surface has for main characteristic a spontaneous magnetization presence which appears after a magnetic field is applied on it. However this magnet effect may vanish if the temperature where this material is increase. This is what we wanted to model.
